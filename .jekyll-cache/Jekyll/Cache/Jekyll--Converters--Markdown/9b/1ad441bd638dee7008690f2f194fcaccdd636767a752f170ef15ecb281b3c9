I"E<p>“World’s first stable crypto-currency backed 100% by the invested capital.
PINE paves a way for the general public to have efficient investments.</p>

<p>How does that work?</p>

<p>The capital accumulated in the pool is reinvested in the markets by a team of analysts.
So in a summary, 
We “Pinewood capital management” are a hedgefund providing asset management to people of all classes through PINE. 
PINE is a crypto currency who’s value is reflected by the returns of the pool. 
That means pine is not only 100% backed by the investment capital but the value of the coin increases as per the pool.
This makes the coin extremely reliable and safe compared to all the currencies available in the market. 
We envision PINE to be the first widely accepted currency for all digital transactions throughout the world.”</p>
