# Welcome to Jekyll!


# In addition to these settings, there is a file _data/tokens-template.yml
# that you'll want to customize for your site. It's named 'tokens' because
# that was it's original purpose, but because tokens.yml is .gitexcluded, it's
# a good place to store your site-specific data that you'd rather not have
# forked or cloned. Of course, that means you'd want to back it up elsewhere.

# Also, for your post bylines, add author info for yourself in `_data/authors.yml`.
# (Using that method instead of site.owner, in case your posts get cloned with your repo.)

  title: Introducing Pine 
  text: |
        "World's first stable crypto-currency backed 100% by the invested capital.
        PINE paves a way for the general public to have efficient investments.

        How does that work?
        
        The capital accumulated in the pool is reinvested in the markets by a team of analysts.
        So in a summary, 
        We "Pinewood capital management" are a hedgefund providing asset management to people of all classes through PINE. 
        PINE is a crypto currency who's value is reflected by the returns of the pool. 
        That means pine is not only 100% backed by the investment capital but the value of the coin increases as per the pool.
        This makes the coin extremely reliable and safe compared to all the currencies available in the market. 
        We envision PINE to be the first widely accepted currency for all digital transactions throughout the world."

# and full paths of the various OSes in compose.rb. For my Windows
# environment, I just put a subl.cmd file in my PATH that points to the full
# path to Sublime's subl.exe.) Also, put your most common post extension.
